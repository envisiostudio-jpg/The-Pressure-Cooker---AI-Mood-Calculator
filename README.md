# Interactive Mood Pressure Calculator (Single‑File HTML)

An AI-driven interactive mood calculator implemented as a **single HTML file**. The application analyzes a user’s daily experiences directly in the browser to generate a personalized **“pressure level”** reading, along with AI-inspired insights for reflection and self-awareness.

This project is designed for simplicity, portability, and ease of use—no backend, build tools, or installation required.

## Features

* Single-file **HTML** application (open and run in any modern browser)
* Interactive form for daily mood and experience input
* Personalized **Pressure Level Reading** (low → critical)
* AI-inspired logic for insight generation
* Client-side processing (no data leaves the browser)
* Clean, readable structure suitable for demos and portfolios

---

## Pressure Level Concept

The **Pressure Level** represents a synthesized estimate of mental and emotional load for a given day. It is derived from browser-based analysis of:

* Self-reported mood
* Stress intensity
* Energy and focus levels
* Notable daily events

The logic interprets these inputs to:

* Highlight emotional patterns
* Detect high-pressure signals
* Provide reflective feedback

---

## Tech Stack

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3** (embedded or inline)
* **Vanilla JavaScript** (embedded in the HTML file)
* Optional AI/LLM API integration (client-side or via proxy)

---

## File Structure

```text
mood-pressure-calculator.html
```

All markup, styling, and logic are contained within a single file for maximum portability.

---

## Usage

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open `mood-pressure-calculator.html` in any modern web browser
3. Enter details about your day using the interactive form
4. View your calculated pressure level and generated insights instantly

---

## Example Output

```text
Pressure Level: Moderate

Insights:
- Elevated stress detected during high-focus periods
- Positive mood correlation with breaks or social interaction
- Consider pacing tasks to reduce pressure accumulation
```
