Interactive Mood Pressure Calculator (Python)

An AI-driven interactive mood calculator built in Python that analyzes a user’s daily experiences to generate a personalized "pressure level" score. The application processes qualitative and quantitative inputs—such as mood, stressors, energy levels, and daily events—and applies AI-assisted logic to produce structured insights and trend awareness.

This project is designed for developers interested in human-centered computing, AI-assisted analysis, and clean, extensible Python architecture.

Features

Interactive daily mood and experience input

Personalized Pressure Level Score (low → critical)

AI-driven insights and pattern detection

Explainable scoring logic

Modular and extensible design

CLI-based (easily adaptable to web or GUI)

Well-documented and open-source friendly

Pressure Level Concept

The Pressure Level represents a synthesized measure of mental and emotional load for a given day. It is calculated using:

Self-reported mood

Stress intensity

Number and type of stressors

Energy and focus levels

Notable daily events

The AI layer interprets these inputs to:

Identify emotional trends

Detect overload or recovery patterns

Generate reflective insights

Tech Stack

Python 3.9+

Rule-based scoring + AI/NLP-ready analysis layer

Optional LLM integration (OpenAI-compatible)

Standard Python libraries (dataclasses, typing, argparse)
